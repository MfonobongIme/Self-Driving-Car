# Self-Driving Car Project

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a self-driving car using the Udacity drive simulator. The goal of the project is to train a neural network to drive the car autonomously around a track. The model is trained using a dataset of images and steering angles collected from human driving.

## Installation
1. Download and install the Udacity drive simulator from [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.
3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

## Usage
1. Launch the Udacity drive simulator and select the autonomous mode.
2. Run the following command to start the autonomous driving:
3. The car should start driving autonomously around the track.

## Training
1. Collect data by driving the car manually around the track in the Udacity drive simulator.
2. Use the collected data to train the model by running the following command:
3. The trained model will be saved as `model.h5` in the root directory.

## Note
- Make sure to run the code in an environment with all the required dependencies installed.
- The code is tested on python 3.7
