# Self-Driving Car Project

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a self-driving car using the Udacity drive simulator. The goal of the project is to train a neural network to drive the car autonomously around a track. The model is trained using a dataset of images and steering angles collected from human driving.

## Training
1. The training data is collected by driving the car manually around the track in the Udacity drive simulator.
2. The collected data is used to train the model using the `self_driving_car.ipynb` file
3. The trained model saved as `model.h5` in the root directory.

## Usage
1. Launch the Udacity drive simulator and select the autonomous mode.
2. Navigate to the project's home directory and run the following command to start the autonomous driving:
```bash
python dive.py
